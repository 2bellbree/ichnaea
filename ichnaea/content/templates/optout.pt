        For general information please have a look at the general

    <h3>How do I prevent my wireless access point from being collected?</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        Mozilla's client applications do not collect information about WiFi
        access points whose SSID is hidden or ends with the string "_nomap".
        If you would like to prevent your WiFi access point from being reported
        to this service, you can rename your SSID to append "_nomap" to the name
        (e.g., SSID "MyWirelessNetwork" becomes "MyWirelessNetwork_nomap")
        or configure your SSID to be hidden.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        This approach is used by other companies offering similar services.
        We have chosen to follow the example established by others, to make
        sure you do not have to learn about specific ways to opt-out of this
        service, but can generally signal your desire to do so and have that
        signal be respected by multiple services.
