    <p>
        You can either choose to use on the
        <a href="/apps">existing client applications</a>
        or use this service directly via its HTTP API.
        Please refer to the
        <a href="https://mozilla-ichnaea.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">
            development documentation</a>
        if you want to use the service directly.
    </p>

    <p>
        At this stage the service is open to anyone, who wants to
        contribute back to the service, non-commercial open-source
        applications and users who more generally support the
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">Mozilla mission</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>API Keys</h3>

    <p>
        In order to use the service API you need to obtain an API key.
        If you use one of the existing applications, there is a good
        chance those applications already come with an API key included.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are developing a new application, please
        <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, describing your use-case
        and intended usage of the service to obtain an API key.
    </p>
