        Depending on your use-case, you might be able to use one of the
        <a href="/apps">existing client applications</a> using this service.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you are developing a website or a web application (for example
        a Firefox OS application) you don't interact with this location
        service directly. Instead you use the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation">
            HTML5 geolocation web api</a>. This will give you the best
        position estimate which the device can determine, based on all
        available sensors (including GPS) and all enabled backend location
        services.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you are developing a native application or library for a desktop
        operating system or Android, you can in principle use this service
        via its HTTPS API. Please refer to the
        <a href="https://mozilla-ichnaea.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">
            development documentation</a> for the details.
        On most other operating systems, you cannot access the required
        cell and WiFi network information required to call the service API.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        At this stage the service is open to anyone, who wants to
        contribute back to the service and applications supporting the
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/mission/">Mozilla mission</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        The service is currently provided as-is, without any guarantee
        on uptime, availability, accuracy of results or continued existence.
        We also don't offer any commercial plans to use the service
        and have no plans to provide such. You are free to run your own
        instance of the service using the open-source code and publicly
        available data from <a href="/downloads">our downloads section</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>API Keys</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        In order to use the service API you need to obtain an API key.
        If you use one of the existing applications, there is a good
        chance those applications already come with an API key included.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We require these API keys as one way to prevent abuse of the
        service. We are unfortunately the target of constant attacks
        and need to protect against these. The API keys are not
        permanently stored with any of the submitted data, but merely
        act as a way to rate limit the number of incoming requests
        from any one application.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you are developing a new application, please contact
        <a href="mailto:Hanno Schlichting %3Chschlichting@mozilla.com%3E">
            Hanno Schlichting</a> to obtain an API key.
        Please make sure to describe your use-case and intended use of
        the service. If you merely want to test out the service for a
        small experiment, please use the literal "test" API key. We'll
        switch to providing rotating public UUID based API keys soon,
        so do not depend on this key for anything outside of initial
        experiments.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We'll try to get back to you in a manner of days, but depending
        on vacation times it might take longer.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        If you do not qualify for free access to this service or need
        SLA's  you can run your own instance of the service, using the
        open-source <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea">
            service code called ichnaea</a> and use the available data
        from the <a href="/downloads">downloads section</a>.
