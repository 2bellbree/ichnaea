            The Mozilla Location Service (MLS) is an open service which
            lets devices determine their location based on network
            infrastructure like Bluetooth beacons, cell towers and
            WiFi access points. This network based location service
            complements satellite based navigation systems like A-GPS.

        <p>
            This open service relies on a community of contributors,
            ranging from <a href="/apps">individuals collecting data</a>,
            <a href="/api">developers using and innovating</a>
            on top of the service to
            <a href="/contact">organizations sharing information</a>
            about their infrastructure.
