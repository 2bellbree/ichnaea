    <p>Welcome to the Mozilla Location Service.</p>

    <p>
        The Mozilla Location Service is a research project to
        investigate crowdsourced mapping of wireless networks (WiFi access
        points, cell towers, etc.) around the world. Mobile devices and
        desktop computers commonly use this information to figure out
        their location when GPS satellites are not accessible.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are few high-quality sources for this kind of geolocation
        data currently open to the public. The Mozilla Location Service
        aims to address this issue by aiming to provide an open service
        to provide location data. 
    </p>

    <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>

    <p>
        You can download our “MozStumbler” client application and start
        mapping the wireless networks in your neighborhood. MozStumbler
        is an Android app that collects information about wireless networks
        near you and reports this information to Mozilla. As you walk or
        drive around town, MozStumbler listens for nearby wireless networks
        to periodically broadcast their network ID.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can
        <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/MozStumbler/releases">
            install the latest build of MozStumbler</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just for fun, you can optionally enter a nickname to track the
        number of networks you have contributed and compare your progress
        to other users on <a href="/leaders">our leaderboard</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What kind of data does MozStumbler send?</h3>

    <p>
        MozStumbler records your device's GPS location and a list of the
        wireless network and cell IDs seen at that location and sends that
        information to Mozilla’s servers. We use this data in accordance
        with <a href="/privacy">our Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you enter an optional nickname to track the number of networks
        you have contributed, MozStumbler will also send that nickname to
        Mozilla. While this nickname gets uploaded to our servers, we don't
        associate the nickname with the raw positioning data that MozStumbler
        uploads.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I prevent my wireless access point from being collected?</h3>

    <p>
        MozStumbler does not collect information about WiFi access points
        whose SSID is hidden or ends with the string "_nomap". If you would
        like to prevent your WiFi access point from being reported to Mozilla,
        you can rename your SSID to append "_nomap" to the name
        (e.g., SSID "MyWirelessNetwork" becomes "MyWirelessNetwork_nomap")
        or configure your SSID to be hidden.
    </p>

    <p>
        MozStumbler also attempts to avoid reporting personal mobile devices.
        MozStumbler filters out some MAC addresses with vendor prefixes of
        mobile device manufacturers (e.g. Apple) and SSIDs that are commonly
        used by mobile devices (e.g., "iPhone" or "MiFi"").
