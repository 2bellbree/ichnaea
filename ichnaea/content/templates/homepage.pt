            The Mozilla Location Service (MLS) is an open service which lets
            devices determine their location based on network infrastructure
            like WiFi access points and cell towers. This network based
            location service complements satellite based navigation systems
            like A-GPS. Combined these two approaches are one of the
            foundations for enabling context aware applications.

            This open service relies on a community of contributors, ranging
            from <a href="/leaders">individuals collecting data</a>,
            <a href="/apps">developers using and innovating</a> on top of
            the service to
            <a href="/contact">organizations sharing information</a>
            about their infrastructure.
