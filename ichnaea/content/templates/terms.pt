        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>No SLA</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        These Terms are not a service level agreement and Mozilla is not
        required to maintain any particular level or service or uptime in
        connection with MLS. The service may experience downtime or become
        unavailable without notice.
    </p>

    <h3>Indemnification</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Mozilla, its
        contractors, contributors, licensors, and partners, and their
        respective directors, officers, employees and agents ("Indemnified
        Parties") from and against any and all third party claims and expenses,
        including attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to your use of the
        Services (including, but not limited to, from any content uploaded by
        you).

    <h3>Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability</h3>

    <p class="text-justified text-uppercase-disclaimer">
        MLS is provided "as is" with all faults. To the extent permitted by
        law, Mozilla and the indemnified parties hereby disclaim all
        warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation
        warranties that the service is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
        particular purpose, and non-infringing.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified text-uppercase-disclaimer">
        You bear the entire risk as to selecting the service for your purposes
        and as to the quality and performance of the service. This limitation
        will apply notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any
        remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified text-uppercase-disclaimer">
        Except as required by law, Mozilla and the indemnified parties will not
        be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or
        exemplary damages arising out of or in any way relating to these Terms
        or the use of or inability to use the service, including without
        limitation direct and indirect damages for loss of goodwill, work
        stoppage, lost profits, loss of data, and computer failure or
        malfunction, even if advised of the possibility of such damages and
        regardless of the theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) upon which such
        claim is based. The collective liability of Mozilla and the indemnified
        parties under these terms will not exceed $500 (five hundred dollars).
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
        incidental, consequential, or special damages, so this exclusion and
        limitation may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <h3>Modifications to these Terms</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We may update these Terms from time to time. The updated Terms will be
        posted online. If the changes are substantive, we will announce the
        update through our usual channels for such announcements such as blog
        posts, banners, emails, or forums. Your continued use of the service
        after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of
        such changes.
    </p>

    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Mozilla
        concerning the service and supersede any prior versions of these Terms.
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California,
        U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. All claims and
        disputes arising out of the Communications or these Terms shall be
        brought exclusively in the courts of Santa Clara County, California,
        and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any
        portion of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
        remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event
        of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the
        English language version, the English language version shall control.
        In the event of a conflict between these Terms and relevant additional
        terms, the additional terms shall control.
