The first time you use alembic, it will automatically create an
`alembic_version` table for you.

To update your schema to the latest version, just issue this command:

```
$ alembic upgrade head
```


To downgrade your database to a specific database version, you will need
the hash in ichnaea/alembic/versions.

Example ::

```
$ alembic downgrade 2a311d11a90d
```


Creating a new revision is done by issuing the `revision` command and
`-m` to pass in a comment.

```
alembic revision -m "your database revision comment here"
```

That will generate a script to do upgrades and downgrades of the
database.

---

Stamping the database as 'current'. If you generate the database
directly from the models, you can use `alembic stamp head` to just
force alembic to assume that everything is in sync. Subsequent
database migrations will work correctly.
