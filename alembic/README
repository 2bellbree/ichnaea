The first time you use alembic, it will automatically create an
`alembic_version` table for you.

To update your schema to the latest version, just issue this command:

```
$ alembic upgrade head
```


To downgrade your database to a specific database version, you will need
the hash in ichnaea/alembic/versions.

Example ::

```
$ alembic downgrade 2a311d11a90d
```
