Unit tests
----------

If you have a local development environment setup, you can run all tests
including coverage tests via:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

Or run individual test modules or functions via for example:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test TESTS=ichnaea.tests.test_geoip


Testing tasks
-------------

We have a good number of asynchronous tasks, executed by celery in the code.
The easiest way to test them is by writing unit tests and calling the task
functions directly.

In order to do more integration testing, you can also manually queue a task
by using the celery `call` command. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ICHNAEA_CFG=ichnaea.ini bin/celery -A ichnaea.async.app:celery_app call \
    ichnaea.data.tasks.update_cell --args='[1000, ]â€™

You then need to run the celery worker process and it will pick up the task
from the queue and execute it:

.. code-block:: bash

    ICHNAEA_CFG=ichnaea.ini bin/celery \
    -A ichnaea.async.app:celery_app worker -c 1


Functional tests
----------------

If you have a local or remote instance of the service running, you can
send it test requests to ensure all parts of the service are running.

If you are testing a remote service, you need to look up a valid lat/lon
combination for the country you are making the request from, and substitute
the `1.23` / `3.45` values in the later examples.

First submit some new data:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -k -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://<hostname>/v1/submit?key=test -d \
    '{"items": [{"lat": 1.23, "lon": 3.45, "wifi": [{"key": "01005e901001"}, {"key": "01005e901012"}]}]}'

Which should get you a `204 No Content` response.

There is no result right away:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -k -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://<hostname>/v1/search?key=test -d \
    '{"wifi": [{"key": "01005e901001"}, {"key": "01005e901012"}]}'

Which means you get a `200 OK` response with a body of
`{"status": "not_found"}` or alternatively a GeoIP based position estimate.

After the async scheduled tasks have run (every minute), there should
be a result:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -i -k -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://<hostname>/v1/search?key=test -d \
    '{"wifi": [{"key": "01005e901001"}, {"key": "01005e901012"}]}'

Again a `200 OK` response with a JSON body like:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {"status": "ok", "lat": 1.23, "lon": 3.45, "accuracy": 100}
